    "The reason why we don't have a contradiction here is because null hypotheses don't tell a complete picture of capturing the variability in the depentdent variable. We could have (and we do) individual independent variables that are statistically significant, i.e., they undoubtedly have an effect, but the effect they have could be small in magnitude. Thus the overall model doesn't explain the majority of the variance, meaning we are either missing key variables, our output is random, or some other confounding factor isn't accounted for."

Note that for each test, model6 seems to be better at predicting the data from the next generation, based on the value of R^2. This means that model7 seems to be overfitting to some generation-specific artifacts, inhibiting its predictive power compared to the relatively simple model6. Thus we can say that model7 probably overfits to the data based on the generation."

    "# ChatBot usage overview\n",
    "### I used ChatGPT, all in one session (so the summary is rather long). Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/67366277-6914-8010-8398-4b9b57b00dc2\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Here's a detailed summary of our conversation, tailored to your homework assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Concepts and Code Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored multiple aspects of linear regression models, particularly focusing on **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** and evaluating model performance. Below is a breakdown of the key topics covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) vs. Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SLR** involves modeling a dependent variable based on a single predictor variable, while **MLR** expands on this by using multiple predictor variables.\n",
    "- **MLR** allows for the inclusion of **interaction terms** (e.g., the combined effect of two variables), **categorical variables** (via encoding), and **continuous variables**, enabling more complex and accurate models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Model Development and Extensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 3: Baseline Model (HP ~ Attack + Defense)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, a simple model (`model3_spec`) was fit using the predictors `Attack` and `Defense` to predict `HP`.\n",
    "- We evaluated both in-sample and out-of-sample performance using \\( R^2 \\) values, where in-sample \\( R^2 \\) reflected the model's fit to the training data, and out-of-sample \\( R^2 \\) assessed the model's generalization ability on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 4: Adding Interaction Terms (HP ~ Attack * Defense * Speed * Legendary)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interaction Terms** were added to the model in `model4_linear_form`, considering the combined effects between variables like `Attack`, `Defense`, `Speed`, and `Legendary`.\n",
    "- This model aimed to capture more complex relationships between predictors and `HP`, especially when the interaction terms have a combined impact on the dependent variable that isn't fully explained by individual predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 5: Adding Categorical Variables (HP ~ Attack + Speed + Q(\"Sp. Def\") + Q(\"Sp. Atk\") + C(Generation) + C(Q(\"Type 1\")) + C(Q(\"Type 2\")))**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical Variables**: `Generation`, `Type 1`, and `Type 2` were incorporated as categorical predictors using **dummy encoding** (i.e., `C(Variable)`), enabling the model to account for differences between distinct groups.\n",
    "- This model represents an important shift towards including both **continuous** and **categorical** variables while still trying to keep the model relatively simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 6: Significant Indicator Variables (HP ~ Attack + Speed + Q(\"Sp. Def\") + Q(\"Sp. Atk\") + Indicators for Type and Generation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Significant indicators from previous models (e.g., `Q(\"Type 1\")==\"Normal\"` and `Q(\"Type 1\")==\"Water\"`) were added, indicating important categorical groupings based on domain knowledge or previous model results.\n",
    "- This step refined the model by **pruning** unnecessary variables and focusing on the most significant ones, improving both interpretability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 7: Introducing Interaction Terms and Scaling (HP ~ Attack * Speed * Q(\"Sp. Def\") * Q(\"Sp. Atk\") + Indicators)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interaction terms were expanded again, now with `Speed`, `Attack`, `Sp. Def`, and `Sp. Atk`, to capture the joint effects of these variables.\n",
    "- The addition of **centered and scaled** variables (via `scale(center())`) helps improve model stability, especially when variables have different scales.\n",
    "  - **Centering** adjusts the variable by subtracting the mean, making interpretation easier (especially for interaction terms).\n",
    "  - **Scaling** normalizes the variance, making the model more efficient in terms of coefficient estimation and improving model convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Evaluation: In-sample and Out-of-sample Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **In-Sample Performance (R²)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In-sample \\( R^2 \\) indicates how well the model fits the **training data**. A higher value suggests that the model explains most of the variability in the training data. However, this can be misleading if the model overfits (i.e., learns noise in the training data rather than true patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Out-of-Sample Performance (R²)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out-of-sample \\( R^2 \\) evaluates the model's performance on **new data**, reflecting its ability to **generalize** to unseen samples.\n",
    "- A discrepancy where in-sample \\( R^2 \\) is much higher than out-of-sample \\( R^2 \\) can indicate overfitting—where the model is too complex and tailored to the training data, reducing its ability to predict unseen data accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Cross-Validation and Generalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final example, a cross-validation approach was applied to a new dataset (`songs`) with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Splitting and Model Fitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "songs_training_data, songs_testing_data = train_test_split(songs, train_size=31)\n",
    "linear_form = 'danceability ~ energy * loudness + energy * mode'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The dataset `songs` was split into training and testing sets, and a linear model was specified, using **interaction terms** to model `danceability` based on predictors like `energy`, `loudness`, and `mode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model Evaluation over Multiple Repetitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(reps):\n",
    "    songs_training_data, songs_testing_data = train_test_split(songs, train_size=31)\n",
    "    final_model_fit = smf.ols(formula=linear_form, data=songs_training_data).fit()\n",
    "    in_sample_Rsquared[i] = final_model_fit.rsquared\n",
    "    out_of_sample_Rsquared[i] = \\\n",
    "      np.corrcoef(songs_testing_data.danceability, final_model_fit.predict(songs_testing_data))[0,1]**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Repeated Cross-Validation**: The model was fitted and evaluated on **31 training samples** over **100 repetitions**, providing a robust measure of in-sample and out-of-sample \\( R^2 \\).\n",
    "- The purpose of this is to ensure that the model generalizes well and is not overfitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Visualization of Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\"In Sample Performance (Rsquared)\": in_sample_Rsquared,\n",
    "                   \"Out of Sample Performance (Rsquared)\": out_of_sample_Rsquared})  \n",
    "fig = px.scatter(df, x=\"In Sample Performance (Rsquared)\", \n",
    "                     y=\"Out of Sample Performance (Rsquared)\")\n",
    "fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=[0,1], y=[0,1], name=\"y=x\", line_shape='linear'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- A scatter plot was generated to visualize the relationship between **in-sample** and **out-of-sample** performance. If the points lie close to the diagonal line (representing perfect agreement between the two), the model is said to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Model Interpretation: Multicollinearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development of these models, we observed that adding numerous interaction terms and including both continuous and categorical variables can lead to **multicollinearity**. This occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, which can distort the coefficients and affect the model’s ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, the addition of many highly correlated variables can inflate the **condition number** (as observed in the models), which is a sign of multicollinearity.\n",
    "- **Centering and scaling** help alleviate some of the problems associated with multicollinearity by making the model more stable and improving convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: The gradual development from Model 3 to Model 7 illustrates a progression from a simple model to one that incorporates interactions, categorical variables, and scaling, aiming to find a balance between model complexity and generalizability.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: Both **in-sample** and **out-of-sample** evaluations are crucial in understanding the performance of a model. While in-sample evaluation is necessary for model fit, out-of-sample evaluation ensures that the model is not overfitting and will perform well on new data.\n",
    "- **Overfitting vs. Generalization**: If out-of-sample performance is significantly lower than in-sample performance, it signals that the model may be overfitting and that further refinement (e.g., reducing multicollinearity, tuning interaction terms) is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process demonstrates how to iteratively build and evaluate models, ensuring they are both robust and generalizable, which is essential for making predictions on real-world data."
