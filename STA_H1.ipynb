    "#3B: GPT was better at detecting a spelling error, especially considering I copied the whole error block into the chat. Of course, good coders dont make spelling errors, they copy+paste! Again, perhaps useful for beginners.\n",
    "#3C: Yet again, GPT prevailed. And yet again, it comes most in handy when I (the user) failed to read the message which clearly and succinctly highlighted the issue. Every time I copy stuff into chat, I feel myself getting dumber and less willing to look into problems.\n",
    "#3D: Perhaps if english was not my first language, GPT was helpful here. Otherwise, the error message telling me my parenthesis was left unclosed should suffice. Google of course returned people's niche problems unrelated to the general case.\n",
    "#3E: Both google and GPT returned results, but naturally, GPT was more tolerant of extra gargabe. With google, one must activate the frontal cortex and formulate a sentence describling the issue, and in the process very often uncover what the solution was the whole time.\n",
    "#3F: I prefer GPT for this one, since the meaning of a KeyError was not immediately obvious to me.\n",
    "#3G: GPT was faster at finding the issue, especially helpful if you know next to no Python, and are unfamiliar with the most basic errors. Google, as usual, works too, requiring proper phrasing: \"What is the [error name] error in Python?\""
