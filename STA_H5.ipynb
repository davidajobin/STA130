    "Hypothesis testing is making a claim about a parameter of the population, namely, mu, the population average. The claim is of the form mu = mu_0, where mu_0 is what the null hypothesis assumes the population average is. We then simulate taking many samples from a data distribution (such that mu=mu_0), and we compare that sampling distribution (the distribution of sample means, x_i) to our original sample mean (x_hat). In this sense, we deduce how realistic that should the null hypothesis be true, our original sample statistic could be achieved. If unrealistic, we can \"throw out\" the null hypothesis, and make a conclusion (inference) about the population, namely, that mu =/= mu_0."

I want to see if this belief is consistent with my sample of 80 STA130 students, 49 of whom correctly guessed the type of beverage they drank. To do this, I will assume my formal null hypothesis: That r (the proportion of the population (humans who drink a cup of tea and guess correctly about the milk-adding) who correctly guess the milk-situation is 0.5. So my hypothesis (r=0.5) says that on average, people cannot beat the odds on milk-guessing.

    "### Hypothesis Testing and Binomial Test\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context**: \n",
    "   You were tasked with analyzing an experiment in which 80 students were asked to determine if milk or tea was poured first in a cup. The null hypothesis was that students were randomly guessing, so the proportion of correct guesses would be 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Null Hypothesis**: \n",
    "   The null hypothesis was that the proportion of correct guesses is 0.5 (i.e., students are guessing randomly). The alternative hypothesis was that the proportion is not 0.5 (i.e., students are not guessing randomly).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis Test**:\n",
    "   We used a **binomial test** to evaluate whether the observed proportion of correct guesses (49 out of 80) is significantly different from the expected 0.5 under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Key Points**:\n",
    "   - **Observed Proportion**: Calculated as \\( \\frac{49}{80} = 0.6125 \\).\n",
    "   - **Binomial Test**: We used `stats.binom_test` from **SciPy** to test whether the proportion of correct guesses was significantly different from 0.5. The test is based on the binomial distribution, and it provides the exact p-value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Code**:\n",
    "   The code used to perform the test is as follows:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "   import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Set the seed for reproducibility\n",
    "   np.random.seed(1)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Given data\n",
    "   n = 80  # Total number of students\n",
    "   x = 49  # Number of correct guesses\n",
    "   p_null = 0.5  # Null hypothesis: proportion of correct guesses is 0.5\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Calculate the observed proportion of correct guesses\n",
    "   observed_proportion = x / n\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Run a two-tailed binomial test using scipy.stats.binom_test\n",
    "   result = stats.binom_test(x, n, p_null, alternative='two-sided')\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Output the results\n",
    "   print(f\"Observed proportion: {observed_proportion:.3f}\")\n",
    "   print(f\"P-value (two-tailed test): {result:.5f}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **P-value Interpretation**:\n",
    "   The `binom_test` directly calculates the p-value based on the binomial distribution without needing simulations or iterations. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the students' guesses are significantly different from random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis**: The hypothesis that the proportion of correct guesses is 0.5 (random guessing).\n",
    "   - **Alternative Hypothesis**: The hypothesis that the proportion is different from 0.5.\n",
    "   - **p-value**: The probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) under the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   The test provides a p-value, which helps us determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is smaller than the significance level (typically 0.05), we would conclude that the students are not just guessing randomly.\n"
